    <p>Hi there!</p>
    <p>My name is Zoe Kafkes and I like to communicate.</p>
    <p>A recent graduate of the University of Miami, I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Communication with majors in public relations and political science with a minor in marketing (and I did it summa cum laude).</p>
    <p>I prefer to see the world through my camera lens. Different types of paper make me excited. If given the choice between sitting by a pool or going on a hike, I would pick the hike every single time. Cooking is my favorite kind of science (and the only one I would say I'm particulary good at). Coffee might be my one true love. </p>
    <p> Check out my work. You won't regret it. </p>
